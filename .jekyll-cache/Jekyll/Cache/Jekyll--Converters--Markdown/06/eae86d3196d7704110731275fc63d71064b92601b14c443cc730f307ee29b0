<p>The simplest way to get up and running is to <a href="https://social.fitopen.org">join our Mastodon community</a>. One look at our <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/roadmap.md">roadmap</a>, however, and youâ€™ll soon see we have many big plans. These will take some time to come to fruition. If you have ideas for website content, please send me a message. Anybody can suggest improvements to our code over at <a href="https://github.com/fitopen">Github</a>. This includes designs, project plans, priorities, core documents (such as the <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">code of conduct</a>), scripts to get the draft codebase implemented - any feedback or assistance is most welcome and absolutely encouraged. Lastly we have setup as a (TBD social enterprise) and can now take donations to cover our running costs of this effortâ€™s website, its social network, and testing and development of these <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/roadmap.md">roadmap</a> plans.</p>
