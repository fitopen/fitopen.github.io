<p>We’re unpacking our code over at <a href="https://github.com/fitopen">Github</a>. Much of this website’s material should be considered early drafts and therefore a work in constant progress. The most significant draft documents are: <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/roadmap.md">roadmap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">code of conduct</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/ethics_policy.md">ethics</a>. These define expected user behaviour, escalation process, our key targets, and a description of where this social business is heading.</p>

<p>During late 2019 these documents and website shall be overhauled. The most visually significant of these changes will be the implementation of a static website content management system (CMS), Siteleaf. This will provide a less technical interface for the implementation of collaborative website content. We’d love to hear the industry perpective from ethically aligned content creators.</p>

<p>Fit Open uses a social media alternative for its ambitious community. Mastodon is an Open Source and decentralised social media network with over 2.2 MILLION users and THOUSANDS of federated instances. We can connect to most users on Mastodon, even though our specific instance has a small membership.</p>

<p>Initially created as a more ethical alternative to Twitter, Mastodon now implements open web standards and could not be defined as being owned by a single entity (due to the software’s copyleft AGPL-3.0 license). We’ve had <a href="https://social.fitopen.org/">our Mastodon instance</a> active since 2018. To quickly grasp the decentralised model of Mastodon, consider a technology such as email and the rather large number of mail server organisations able to communicate with each other using standardised protocols. In the same way Google does not own email, Facebook and Twitter should perhaps not own our social interactions.</p>

<p>Why don’t you just stick with (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Blogger etc.)? If the whole world stuck to the same big tech companies there would be little opportunity for change. There has been plenty of troubles on each of these social network sites. Ultimately there is little end users can do to shape these proprietary platforms. By instead adhering to openness, transparency, growth, autonomy, standards, <a href="https://github.com/fitopen/main/blob/master/ethics_policy.md">ethics</a>, and most of all the big picture - together we build an industry definition based on OUR needs. Not those of big off-shore multinational tech companies.</p>

<p>Concepts such as this underpin our ethics policy. By demanding this, we help shape open web tools in a manner that is rooted in a search for a higher ideal. For everyone!</p>
