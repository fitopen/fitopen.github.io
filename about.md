# About Fit Open

<p>"If at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again" Aaliyah Dana Haughton (1979-2001)</p>

<p>During a dark phase in my life, I became inspired by entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs have this amazing knack of overcoming adversity. Not coming first. Recovering from failure. Struggling to get out of bed. Picking themselves back up. Trying again. Becoming obsessed. Until it gets done.</p>

<p>I certified as a personal trainer and rapidly found the entrepreneurial spirit alive in other PTs. Helping people to physically move in more efficient and improved ways. Often solving many of their clients personal pains through the process.</p>

<p>A common theme among entrepreneurs became difficult to ignore. Not only do they push themselves in their business day to day. They also push just as hard in their free time.</p>

<p>Many of them are keen sports people. But not any old sport. Outdoor fitness.</p>

<p>Keen runners, swimmers, cyclists, mountain climbers, hikers, these people soon become disinterested in plodding along with no function. It's not long before they are entering competitions, rasing money for charities, and very often ramping it up into endurance sports. Marathons, Ultras, Triathlons, Cycling Tours, and the like.</p>

<p>Recognising that training for these events takes many months of preparation, I hit on an idea: what if those amazing one day events, along with their supportive services, were available all year round, no matter where in the world they were?</p>

<p>Facilities traditionally get all the funding and glory. But sports people, like this, often just throw on a pair of shoes and go. Wherever in the world they find themselves</p>

<p>'Fit Open' strives to connect these sports people with: outdoor spaces, facilities, specialist experts, hyper local small businesses, not for profits & charities.</p>

<p>'Fit Open' fully intends to enable people and their communities to improve in a wholly sustainable way. We commit to creating a platform that assists entrepreneurs, fitness experts, and charities to collaborate in a way like never before.</p>

<p>'Fit Open' represents a grassroots community, recognising its strengths lay in empower the self. Through independence, versatility, co-operation, collaboration, and partnerships: a collective of individuals holds untapped power.</p>

<p>We're breaking apart the traditional fitness industry model.</p>

<p>Fitness is not a place you go to. Fitness is a way of life.</p>
